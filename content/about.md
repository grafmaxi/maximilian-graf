Since 2022, I have been a PhD student at the University of Potsdam, supervised by [Alexandra Carpentier](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandracarpentierresearch/home) (University of Potsdam) and [Nicolas Verzelen](https://verzelen.montpellier.inrae.fr) (INRAE Montpellier). My work is funded by the DFG Research Unit [FOR 5381](https://for5381.uni-freiburg.de).

My research interests lie in mathematical statistics and the mathematics underlying machine learning. In particular, I focus on various aspects of unsupervised learning. So far, I have worked on ranking problems in crowdsourcing and clustering in bandit settings.
