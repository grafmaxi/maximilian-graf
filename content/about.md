title: "About Me"

Since 2022, I have been a PhD student at the University of Potsdam, supervised by Alexandra Carpentier (University of Potsdam) and Nicolas Verzelen (INRAE Montpellier).

My research interests lie in mathematical statistics and the mathematics underlying machine learning. In particular, I focus on various aspects of unsupervised learning. So far, I have worked on ranking problems in crowdsourcing and clustering in bandit settings.
